# Sonar-2D-Mapping
Task for IEEE Recruitment Round 2
Done by Mayank Sharma
Reg No: 20BCT0264
Branch: CSE-IoT (SCOPE)
The project uses an ultrasonic sensor with arduino uno and potentiometer to plot polar coordinates of distant objects using Processing IDE.
Codes are uploaded in the project.
Images can be found too.
Points in the graph are plotted as radius = distance of objects in cm and angle of the object from the mean position.
The project is made without any servo motors so the graphs are not perfect but they will work if used with servos.
Hardware Parts: Arduino UNO, potentiometer, jumper wires, breadboard, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
Softwares: Arduino IDE, Processing IDE.
Objects Tested: Small Room and a Moderate room with random objects.
Thank You!
